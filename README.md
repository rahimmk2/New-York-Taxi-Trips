# New-York-Taxi-Trips

The dataset containing the information about the New York yellow cabs was used to develop a program that could read the file and implement multiple algorithms to perform the relevant traversals to answer multiple queries.

The data was read from a csv file and stored using the data structures of linked list and binary search trees. The implementation of trees allowed an efficent run-time of O log-n to perform searches on the data. Implementing trees allowed to reduce the run-time for searching of the data entered by the user.

The program implemented functions and DFS to search the top 10 cheapest trips in NYC, the most visited locations, and utilized the data to calculate an estimated fare between two locations.
